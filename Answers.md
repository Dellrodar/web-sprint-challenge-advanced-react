1.  Stateful class components are parent components. They are exported, and extend React.Component. They also use the constructer and super methods. They have have state and pass props to child components.
2.  The three phases are Mounting, Updating and Unmounting. Mounting means you are putting elements in the DOM(ex. constructor(), props, render(), componentDidMount()). Updating is when there is a change in the components state or props(ex. componentDidUpdate()). Finally, there is unmounting, which is when a component is removed from the DOM.
3.  See answer 2.
4.  Stateful logic is code that uses state.
5.  In order to test a component, we need to create a test file (ex. CheckoutForm.test.js), import our needed methods from @testing-library/react, and render the component we want to test. (ex. const {container} = render(<CheckoutForm />); ). Depending on the type of component, we may need differewnt methods to test. In the CheckoutForm case we use the render, fireEvent, waitFor, and getByTestId methods.
